### Definition
Let $\left\{ X_{i} \right\}_{i\in I}$ be a family of nonempty [[topological space]]s, then their *disjoint union space* is the set $\mathbin{\unicode{x02A03}}_{i\in I} X_i$ of ordered pairs $\left( x, i\right)$ where $i \in I$ and $x \in X_{i}$, associated with [[topology]] formed by declaring a subset of $\mathbin{\unicode{x02A03}}_{i\in I}X_{i}$ as [[Open Set|open]] if its intersection with each $X_{i}$ is [[open set|set]].
