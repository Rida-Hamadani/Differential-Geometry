#lemma
### Types
- `X` `Y` : [[Topological Space]] 
- $f : X \to Y$
### Statement
If $f$ is [[Continuity|continuous]], surjective, and either [[open map]] or [[closed map]], then it is a [[quotient map]].
### Proof
WLOG we will prove the case when $f$ is [[open map]]. Let $U \subset Y$ such that $f^{-1}\left( U \right)$ is [[open set|open]], then $U = f\left( f^{-1} (U) \right)$ is [[open set|open]], completing the proof.
