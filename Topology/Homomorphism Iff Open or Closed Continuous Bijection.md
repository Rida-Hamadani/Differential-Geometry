#lemma
### Types
- `X` `Y` : [[Topological Space]] 
- $f : X \to Y$
### Statement
If $f$ is [[continuity|continuous]], then the following are equivalent:
- $f$ is a [[homeomorphism]].
- $f$ is bijective and [[open map]].
- $f$ is bijective and [[closed map]].
### Proof

WLOG, we prove that the first 2 statements are equivalent as the logic for 1st and 3rd is the same. A [[homeomorphism]] by definition is bijective. The fact that $f^{-1}$ is [[continuity|continuous]] means that its inverse is an [[open map]], which is $f$ itself.
