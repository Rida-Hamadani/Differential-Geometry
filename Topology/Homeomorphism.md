### Types
- `X` : [[Topological Space]]
- `Y` : [[Topological Space]]
### Definition
A function $f : X \to Y$ is a *homeomorphism* if it satisfies the following properties:
- $f$ is bijective.
- $f$ is [[Continuity|continuous]].
- the inverse function $f^{-1}$ is [[Continuity|continuous]]. 
##### Notes
- The last condition is equivalent to $f$ being an [[open set|open]] map.
