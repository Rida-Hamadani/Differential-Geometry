### Types
- `X` : [[Compact Space]]
- `A` : Subset of `X`
### Statement
The [[subspace topology]] generated by `A` in `X` is a [[compact space]] if and only if every [[Covering of a Subset|covering]] of `A` in `X` has a finite sub[[Covering of a Subset|covering]].
### Proof
Suppose `A` is [[compact space|compact]], let $\left\{ U_{i} \right\}_{i\in I}$ be a [[Covering of a Subset|covering]] of it, then $\left\{ U_{i} \cap A\right\}_{i\in I}$ is a [[covering]] of `A`, as they are [[open set]]s in the [[subspace topology]] of `A`, and as `A` is [[Compact Space|compact]], $\left\{ U_{i} \cap A\right\}_{i\in I}$ a finite [[Refinement of a Covering|refinement]], so $\left\{ U_{i} \cap A\right\}_{i\in J}$ where $J \subset I$ is finite. $\left\{ U_{i} \right\}_{i \in J}$ is a [[Covering of a Subset|covering]] of `A` in `X`.

Conversely, let $\left\{ U_{i} \right\}_{i \in I}$ be a [[covering]] of `A`, then as each $U_{i}$ is an [[open set]] in the [[subspace topology]] of `A` in `X`, there exists $V_{i}$ [[open set]] of `X` such that $U_{i}=V_{i}\cap A$. Thus, $\left\{ V_{i} \right\}_{i\in I}$ is a [[Covering of a Subset|covering]] of `A` in `X`, by our hypothesis, $\left\{ V_{i} \right\}_{i\in J}$ is a [[Covering of a Subset|covering]] of `A` in `X`, where $J$ is a finite subset of $I$, the finite [[covering]] of `A` as $\left\{ V_{i}\cap A \right\}_{i\in J} = \left\{ U_{i} \right\}_{i\in J}$ is a finite [[Refinement of a Covering|refinement]] of $\left\{ U_{i} \right\}_{i \in I}$.
