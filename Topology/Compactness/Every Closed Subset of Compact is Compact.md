#lemma
### Types
- `X` : [[Compact Space]]
- `A` : [[Closed Set]] of `X`
### Statement
`A` is a [[compact space]].
### Proof
Let $\mathcal{U}$ be a [[Covering of a Subset|covering]] of `A` in `X`, then as `A` is [[Closed Set|closed]], $X-A$ is [[open set|open]], and so $\mathcal{U}\cup \left\{X-A\right\}$ is a [[covering]] of `X`, which is a [[compact space]], so $\mathcal{U}\cup \left\{X-A\right\}$ will have a finite [[Refinement of a Covering|refinement]], either $\left\{U_{1}, U_{2}, \cdots, U_{n}\right\}$ or $\left\{U_{1}, U_{2}, \cdots, U_{n}, X - A\right\}$, where $U_{i}$ are in $\mathcal{U}$. In either cases, $\left\{U_{1}, U_{2}, \cdots, U_{n}\right\}$ is a finite [[Covering of a Subset|covering]] of `A` in `X` that is contained in $\mathcal{U}$, which implies that `A` is [[Compact Space|compact]] using the [[Subspace Compactness Criterion]].
