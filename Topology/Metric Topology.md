### Types
- $(X, d)$ : [[Metric Space]]
### Definition
The *metric topology* over `X` is the [[topology]] over `X` formed by the subsets that can be written as the union of some open balls of `X`, i.e. for any $x_0\in X$ and any $r > 0$:
$$
B(x_0, r) = \left\lbrace x\in X, d\left(x_0,x\right)<r\right\rbrace
$$
