#lemma
### Types
- `X` `Y` : [[Topological Space]] 
- $f : X \to Y$
### Statement
If $f$ is an [[continuity|continuous]] bijection that is either [[open map]] or [[closed map]], then it is a [[homeomorphism]].
### Proof
WLOG we will prove the open case. 
- $f$ is a bijection.
- $f$ is [[Continuity|continuous]].
- $f$ being an [[open map]] implies that $f^{-1}$ is [[continuity|continuous]].
