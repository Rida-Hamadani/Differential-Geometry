### Types
- $\left( X, \mathcal{E} \right)$ : [[Cell Complex]] 
### Definition
$\left( X, \mathcal{E} \right)$ is a *CW complex* if it satisfies the following properties:
- The closure of each [[Cell|cell]] is contained in the union of finitely many [[cell]]s.
- The [[topology]] of $X$ is [[Coherence|coherent]] with the family of [[closed set|closed]] [[Subspace Topology|subspace]]s $\left\{ \overline{e}, e \in \mathcal{E} \right\}$.
The first property is called (C) and the second property is called (W), hence *CW complex*.
