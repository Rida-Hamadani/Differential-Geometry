### Types
- $\left( X, \mathcal{E} \right)$ : [[CW Complex]]
### Definition
If there exists an integer `n` such that all the [[Cell]] of `X` have dimension at most `n`, then `X` is said to be *finite dimensional*, otherwise it is said to be *infinite dimensional*.
If it is *finite dimensional*, then its dimension is the largest `n` such that `X` has at least one n-[[Cell|cell]].
