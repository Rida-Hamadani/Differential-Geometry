### Types
- `X` `Y` : [[Topological Space]]
- `A` : [[Closed Set]] of `Y`
- $f : A \to X$
- $f$ [[continuity|Continuous]]
### Definition
Let `~` be the [[equivalence relation]] on [[Disjoint Union Space|disjoint union]] $X \mathbin{\unicode{x0228D}}Y$ generated by $a \sim f\left( a \right)$ for all $a \in A$. The resulting [[quotient space]] is denoted as $X \cup_{f}Y$, and is called the *adjunction space*.
