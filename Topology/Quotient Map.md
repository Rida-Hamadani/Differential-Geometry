### Types
- X : [[Topological Space]]
- `Y` : Set
- $q : X \to Y$
### Definition
If `Y` has a [[quotient topology]] $\tau$ induced by `q`, then `q` is called the *quotient map* of $\tau$. By definition of the [[quotient topology]], a map is a *quotient map* if $U \subset X$ is [[open set|open]] if and only if  $q^{-1}\left( U \right)$ is [[open set|open]].
##### Note
- In the case where an [[equivalence relation]] was not specified, and $q$ is a surjection, we use the [[quotient topology]] defined by the relation $x \sim y \iff q\left( x \right) = \left( y \right)$.
