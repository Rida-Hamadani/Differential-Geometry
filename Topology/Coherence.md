### Types
- `X` : [[Topological Space]]
### Definition
Given a family of [[Subspace Topology|subspace]]s $\mathcal{B}$ of `X` such that their union is `X`, we say `X` is *coherent* with `B` if a subset in `X` is [[Open Set|open]] if and only if its intersection with each $B \in\mathcal{B}$ is open in $B$.
