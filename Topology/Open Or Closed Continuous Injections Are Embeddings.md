#lemma
### Types
- `X` `Y` : [[Topological Space]] 
- $f : X \to Y$
### Statement
If $f$ is [[Continuity|continuous]], injective, and either [[Open Map|open]] or [[closed map|closed]], then it is a [[topological embedding]].
### Proof
Let $g : X \to f\left( X \right)$ be the same as $f$ but with its range restricted to its image, then it is a [[continuity|continuous]] bijection. [[Homomorphism Iff Open or Closed Continuous Bijection]] finishes the proof.
