### Types
- $\left( X, A \right),\left( Y,B \right)$ : [[Measurable Space]]
- $f:X\to Y$
### Definition
$f$ is a *measurable* if $\forall E \in B, f^{-1}\left( E \right)\in A$.
##### Note
The same definition applies when $\left(Y,B\right)$ is a [[Topological Space]], in which case it could be viewed as $Y$ being equipped with the [[Borel Sigma Algebra]].
