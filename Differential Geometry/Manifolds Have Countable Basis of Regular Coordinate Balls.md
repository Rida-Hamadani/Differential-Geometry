### Types
- `n` : $\mathbb{N}$
- `M` : [[Topological Manifold]] of dimension `n` 
### Statement
`M` has a [[countable]] [[basis]] of [[regular coordinate ball]]s. 
### Proof
Since `M` is [[Locally Euclidean Space|locally Euclidean]], every point of `M` is contained in a [[coordinate neighborhood]], and since `M` is [[second countable]], a [[countable]] collection $\left\{ U_{i}, i \in \mathbb{N} \right\}$ of such neighborhoods covers M by [[Second Countable is Lindel√∂f]].
