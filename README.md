### Introduction
These are my notes for the academic year 2024-2025, where I'm studying for the first year of a masters program in pure mathematics in the Lebanese university.
If you found your way here, then chances are you are my classmate. If you are not, you are still welcome to use these notes, edit them, or contribute to them by opening issues or PRs.
You will find here useful notes about the following subjects:

- Topology and Functional Analysis
- Measure Theory and Probability
- Field and Galois Theory
- Distribution Theory
- Differential Geometry

Please note that due to the difficulty of typesetting high quality notes during live classes, and due to my inability to refine these notes after classes because I have a job, I cannot promise a consistent quality (or quantity!) of notes here. Please do not depend on me and try to take your own notes. That being said, I hope you will find something helpful here.
### Setup
In order to be able to get these notes on your computer, please install `git` and `obsidian`. Both are free, and have a lot of guides on how to install them.
After installing both, run the following in your command prompt in the folder you want to install these notes into:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rida-Hamadani/Math-Notes.git
```
After that, open the cloned file using `obsidian`, and you should have the notes working on your side.
### Getting Updates
To get any update to the notes, run the following in your command prompt in the main folder containing the notes: (you will know it is the main file because it contains the `README` file you are reading right now)
```
git pull
```
### Contributing
I really appreciate if you want to contribute to these notes, you can do so by filling in holes I have not covered yet, or solving more exercises, or providing more examples/counter-examples, or even by correcting typos. All type of contributions are welcome and appreciated. Please open an issue/PR with the contributions. If you are not familiar on how to contribute to a Github project, please contact me and I will help you. Moreover, if you find any difficulties in installing the notes, bring your laptop to class and I'll do it for you, or you can also contact me. Please understand if I take a while to respond, I'm probably busy at my job.
