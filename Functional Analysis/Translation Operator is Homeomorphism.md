#lemma
### Types
- $\left( E, \tau \right)$ : [[Topological Vector Space]]
- `a` : `E`
### Statement
The [[Translation Operator]] by `a` on `E` is a [[Homeomorphism]].
### Proof
By the definition of a [[Topological Vector Space]], the addition is [[continuity|continuous]]. So by fixing the second variable into `a` and `-a`, we get that the [[Translation Operator]] by `a` and by `-a` are continuous.
The second is the inverse of the first, so it is a homeomorphism.
