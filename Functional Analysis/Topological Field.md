### Types
- `F` : [[Field]] 
- $\tau$ : [[Topology]]
- $\left(F,\tau\right)$ : [[Topological Space]]
### Definition
`F` is a *topological field* if all its [[field]] operators (addition, multiplication, and the maps: $a \mapsto a^{-1}$ and $a \mapsto -a$) are [[Topology/Continuity/Continuity|continuous]] on `F`.
