#lemma
### Types
- $\mathbb{K}$ : [[Field]]
- $\left( E, \tau \right)$ : [[Topological Vector Space]] over $\mathbb{K}$
- `a` : $\mathbb{K}$-{0}
### Statement
The [[Multiplication Operator]] by `a` on `E` is a [[Homeomorphism]].
### Proof
By the definition of a [[Topological Vector Space]], the scalar multiplication is [[continuity|continuous]]. So by fixing the scalar variable into $a$ and $a^{-1}$, we get that the [[Multiplication Operator]] by $a$ and by $a^{-1}$ are continuous.
The second is the inverse of the first, so it is a homeomorphism.
